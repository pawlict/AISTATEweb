## What this app does

### Speech-to-text (AI)
- **Whisper (openai-whisper)** is used to transcribe audio into text.  
  Models are **auto-downloaded on first use** (e.g., tiny/base/small/medium/large).

### Voice diarization (AI)
- **pyannote.audio** is used to identify “who spoke when” (speaker diarization) using a Hugging Face pipeline
  (e.g., pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1).  
  This may require:
  - a valid **Hugging Face token**,
  - accepting model-specific terms (“gated” repositories),
  - compliance with the license/terms on the model card.

### Text “diarization” (non-AI / heuristic)
- The **Text diarization** options (e.g., alternating speakers / block speakers) do **not** use AI.
- They work purely on an existing transcript (plain text) and assign labels like **SPK1, SPK2, …**
  using simple rules such as:
  - line/sentence splitting,
  - alternating speaker assignment,
  - block grouping,
  - optional merging of short fragments.

> This is formatting/structuring of text, not real speaker recognition from audio.

## Third-party libraries & components

> Note: many packages are installed as transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies).
> The list below focuses on the main building blocks used by the app.

### GUI
- **PySide6 (Qt for Python)** — application GUI (tabs, widgets, dialogs, QTextBrowser).  
  License: **LGPL** (Qt for Python licensing).

### Speech / diarization
- **openai-whisper** — speech-to-text transcription (Whisper).  
- **pyannote.audio** — speaker diarization pipeline.  
- **huggingface_hub** — downloads models/pipelines from Hugging Face Hub.  

### Core ML / audio stack (typically installed as dependencies)
- **torch** (PyTorch) — neural network runtime used by Whisper / pyannote.
- **torchaudio** — audio utilities for PyTorch (commonly required by pyannote).
- **numpy** — numeric computations (common dependency).
- **tqdm** — progress bars (visible in logs during transcription).
- **soundfile / librosa** — audio I/O / utilities (commonly used in audio pipelines; depends on your environment).

### Audio conversion (external tool)
- **FFmpeg** — used to convert audio to stable **PCM WAV** (e.g., 16kHz mono) when needed.  
  License: depends on distribution/build (LGPL/GPL variants).

## AI models (weights) & usage terms

### Whisper model weights
Whisper model weights may be downloaded automatically on first use.

**Model weight licenses/terms are not always identical to the Python wrapper/package license.**  
Always document:
- the source of model files,
- the license/terms attached to the model weights.

### Pyannote diarization pipelines (Hugging Face)
Voice diarization uses a Hugging Face pipeline repository.  
**You are responsible for following the license/terms shown on the model card of the specific repository you use.**
